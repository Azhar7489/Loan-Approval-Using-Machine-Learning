## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [XYZ Dataset Source](link_to_dataset). It includes various features such as applicant's age, income, credit score, loan amount, etc., and their corresponding loan approval status (0 for not approved, 1 for approved). The dataset is available in the `data` directory.
